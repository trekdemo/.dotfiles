# /generate-slices - Complexity-Aware Vertical Slice Task Generation

**Purpose**: Transform PRD, DRD, and TRD into implementable vertical slices with TDD-first complexity budgeting and validation requirements  
**Philosophy**: Test-first development, fixed complexity budget, variable scope - ship validated, tested software at each slice  
**Previous Steps**: Complete `/create-prd`, optionally `/create-drd` and `/create-trd` first  
**Next Step**: Use `/process-slices` with mandatory TDD and validation framework

Generate a complexity-aware task list driven by design and technical requirements using vertical slices that each deliver demonstrable value.

If not explicitly told which documents to use:
- List available PRDs from `/tasks` directory (files starting with `prd-`)
- Check for corresponding DRDs (`drd-*.md`) and TRDs (`trd-*.md`)
- Exclude any that already have corresponding task lists (`tasks-prd-*.md`)
- **Always** ask user to confirm document selection before proceeding
- Provide numbered options for easy selection
- **Recommend creating DRD/TRD if missing**: "I notice you don't have a DRD/TRD for this PRD. Would you like to create them first? This will result in better-informed implementation tasks."

## Process (Two-Phase Workflow)

### Phase 1: Analysis and Slice Planning

1. **Receive Document References:** User specifies PRD file and complexity budget, with optional DRD/TRD
   - Default complexity budget: 10 points if not specified
   - Validate budget is between 1-32 points
   - Load PRD, DRD (if available), and TRD (if available)

2. **Analyze Requirements:** Read and understand business, design, and technical requirements
   
   **From PRD:**
   - Identify core user flow that demonstrates primary value
   - List all mentioned features and requirements
   - Note future requirements that affect architecture decisions
   
   **From DRD (if available):**
   - Review component hierarchy and user journey maps
   - Understand visual complexity and interaction patterns  
   - Note design system requirements and responsive considerations
   - Identify design circuit breakers and fallback options
   
   **From TRD (if available):**
   - Review system architecture and data models
   - Understand technical complexity and integration requirements
   - Note performance, security, and scalability constraints
   - Identify technical circuit breakers and simplification strategies

3. **Assess Current State:** Review existing codebase against design and technical requirements
   - **Design Assessment (enhanced by DRD):**
     - Identify existing component libraries and design patterns
     - Note current responsive design and accessibility implementations
     - Document existing user experience patterns
   - **Technical Assessment (enhanced by TRD):**
     - Identify existing architecture patterns and technology stack
     - Note current database schema and API structures
     - Document existing authentication, security, and deployment setup
     - List current testing and monitoring infrastructure

4. **üß™ TDD-Aware Complexity Assessment:** Calculate complexity using enhanced model incorporating DRD/TRD insights and mandatory testing requirements
   ```
   Layer 0: Static (1 pt) - No runtime logic, pure UI + component tests + Playwright screenshots
   Layer 1: Interactive (2 pts) - Client state, no persistence + unit tests + integration tests + Playwright interactions  
   Layer 2: Persistent (4 pts) - Single data source, CRUD + API tests + database tests + E2E tests
   Layer 3: Integrated (8 pts) - Multiple services, sync coordination + contract tests + integration tests + system tests
   Layer 4: Orchestrated (16 pts) - Workflows, async state machines + comprehensive test pyramid + performance tests
   Layer 5: Distributed (32 pts) - Multi-deployment, event-driven + distributed testing + chaos testing
   ```
   
   **Enhanced Complexity Factors (from DRD/TRD + Testing Requirements):**
   - **Design Complexity:** Component hierarchy depth, interaction complexity, responsive requirements + UI testing requirements
   - **Technical Complexity:** Data model relationships, API integrations, performance requirements + API testing complexity
   - **Integration Complexity:** External service dependencies, real-time requirements, security constraints + E2E testing needs
   - **üß™ Testing Complexity:** TDD requirements, test pyramid completeness, Playwright UI testing, validation framework overhead
   
   Present integrated assessment to user:
   - **Business Requirements (PRD):** X points needed for core functionality
   - **Design Requirements (DRD):** Y points for visual and interaction requirements
   - **Technical Requirements (TRD):** Z points for architecture and integrations
   - **üß™ Testing Requirements:** A points for TDD, Playwright, and validation overhead
   - **üîç Validation Requirements:** B points for multi-agent validation processes
   - **Total Complexity:** Combined complexity estimate (X+Y+Z+A+B)
   - **Available budget:** User-specified points
   - **Recommendation:** What can be achieved within budget, emphasizing testing and validation requirements

5. **Generate DRD/TRD-Driven Parent Slices:** Create vertical slices based on design and technical requirements
   
   **Slice Definition Strategy:**
   - Each slice must deliver user-visible value (PRD-driven)
   - Each slice must be independently deployable/demoable
   - Slice boundaries follow component hierarchy from DRD (when available)
   - Technical complexity follows data flow from TRD (when available)
   - Order slices by value delivery prioritized by business requirements
   
   **üß™ Enhanced "Test-First, Fake High, Make Low" Pattern:**
   - **Slice 0:** Static mockup using DRD component hierarchy (Layer 0) + component tests + Playwright screenshots
   - **Slice 1:** Add interactions following DRD user flows (Layer 1) + interaction tests + Playwright user flows
   - **Slice 2:** Add persistence following TRD data models (Layer 2) + API tests + database tests + E2E validation  
   - **Slice 3+:** Add integrations per TRD architecture (Layer 3+) + contract tests + system tests + validation gates
   
   **Fallback Strategy (when DRD/TRD unavailable):**
   - Generate slices based on PRD requirements only
   - Make educated guesses about component hierarchy
   - Use standard technical patterns for data and integrations
   
   **Present slices and wait for confirmation:**
   ```
   "I've generated X vertical slices within your complexity budget of Y points.
   Each slice delivers working, demoable functionality.
   Ready to break these down into implementation tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
   ```

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown

6. **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause for user "Go" response

7. **Generate Sub-Tasks per Slice:** For each parent slice, create implementation tasks
   - Group tasks by slice, not by technical layer
   - Each sub-task should be completable in one sitting
   - Include "Definition of Done" for each slice
   - Add circuit breaker/fallback for each risky task
   
   Sub-task categories per slice:
   - Setup tasks (routes, components, configs)
   - Core functionality tasks
   - Integration tasks (if applicable)
   - Testing task (at least one per slice)
   - Deployment verification task

8. **Identify Relevant Files:** List all files to be created/modified
   - Group by slice for clarity
   - Include test files alongside implementation files
   - Note any configuration files needed
   - Flag any files that might hit deployment limits

9. **Add Complexity Metadata:** Include complexity tracking
   - Running complexity total after each slice
   - Remaining budget
   - Simplification options if over budget

10. **Save Task List:** Save to `/tasks/` directory
    - Filename: `tasks-[prd-file-name].md`
    - Include complexity budget in file header
    - Add creation timestamp

[Document what would have been included but is cut for budget]

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Strategy
- Each slice includes at least one test
- Slice 0: Smoke test (route renders)
- Slice 1: Interaction test (state changes)
- Slice 2: Integration test (API + database)
- Slice 3+: Service integration tests (with mocks)

### Deployment Checkpoints
- After each slice, deploy and verify
- Maintain working demo URL throughout
- Never break previously working functionality

### Complexity Escape Hatches
If running over budget during implementation:
1. **Slice 3 too complex?** ‚Üí Mock the external service
2. **Slice 2 database issues?** ‚Üí Use localStorage
3. **Slice 1 state complex?** ‚Üí Simplify to essential interactions
4. **Slice 0 deployment fails?** ‚Üí Run locally for demo

### For Junior Developers
- Start with Slice 0 - get something deployed first
- Each slice builds on the previous - don't skip ahead
- If stuck, implement the circuit breaker (simpler alternative)
- Tests can be simple - just verify the happy path
- Ask for help before spending >30 min on any single sub-task

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Slice 0 Complete (Complexity spent: 1/[budget])
- [ ] Slice 1 Complete (Complexity spent: 3/[budget])
- [ ] Slice 2 Complete (Complexity spent: 7/[budget])
- [ ] Slice 3 Complete (Complexity spent: 15/[budget])

## Next Steps
Run `/process-slices 0` to begin implementation with Slice 0
```

## Interaction Model

The process maintains the two-phase approach:
1. Generate parent slices ‚Üí Get user confirmation ("Go")
2. Generate detailed sub-tasks ‚Üí Ready for implementation

This ensures alignment before diving into details while maintaining vertical slice discipline.

## Key Improvements Over Original

1. **Requirements-Driven Slices**: Slices now follow DRD component hierarchy and TRD technical architecture instead of ad-hoc decisions
2. **Integrated Complexity Assessment**: Combines business (PRD), design (DRD), and technical (TRD) complexity for accurate estimation
3. **Circuit Breakers at Multiple Levels**: Design fallbacks (DRD), technical fallbacks (TRD), and scope fallbacks (PRD)
4. **One-Way Door Prevention**: DRD and TRD analysis ensures future requirements don't get blocked by early decisions
5. **Concrete Implementation Guidance**: Tasks reference specific DRD components and TRD architecture instead of generic patterns
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to PRD-only approach when DRD/TRD unavailable
7. **Enhanced "Fake High, Make Low"**: Each slice follows actual design and technical patterns rather than guessed patterns

## Target Audience

Primary: **Junior developers** who need clear, achievable tasks with fallback options  
Secondary: **AI agents** that can follow structured complexity assessments

## Usage Example

```bash
/generate-slices prd-code-editor.md 10

# Output: 3 slices within 10-point budget
# Slice 0: Static editor UI (1 pt)
# Slice 1: Syntax highlighting (2 pts)  
# Slice 2: Save/load files (4 pts)
# Slice 3: Share via URL (3 pts)
# Total: 10 points allocated

# Slice 4: Real-time collaboration (8 pts) - EXCLUDED, would exceed budget
```
