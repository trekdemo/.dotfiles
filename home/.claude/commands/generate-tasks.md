# /generate-tasks - Enhanced AI Dev Tasks Workflow
**Source**: ai-dev-tasks repository workflow (enhanced with DRD/TRD integration + TDD validation framework)  
**Purpose**: Generate TDD-first task list from PRD, DRD, and TRD with mandatory testing and validation requirements  
**Previous Steps**: Complete `/create-prd`, optionally `/create-drd` and `/create-trd` first  
**Next Step**: Use `/process-slices` with mandatory TDD and validation framework

Please generate TDD-first tasks driven by design and technical requirements with mandatory validation and testing integrated throughout.

If not explicitly told which documents to use:
- List available PRDs from `/tasks` directory (files starting with `prd-`)
- Check for corresponding DRDs (`drd-*.md`) and TRDs (`trd-*.md`)
- Exclude any that already have corresponding task lists (`tasks-prd-*.md`)
- **Always** ask user to confirm document selection before proceeding
- Provide numbered options for easy selection
- **Recommend creating DRD/TRD if missing**: "I notice you don't have a DRD/TRD for this PRD. Would you like to create them first? This will result in more concrete implementation tasks with fewer on-the-fly decisions."

## Process (Enhanced with DRD/TRD Integration)

1. **Receive Document References:** User specifies PRD file with optional DRD/TRD files
   - Load PRD for business requirements
   - Load DRD (if available) for design specifications  
   - Load TRD (if available) for technical architecture

2. **Analyze Integrated Requirements:** Read and understand business, design, and technical requirements
   
   **From PRD:**
   - Identify functional requirements and user stories
   - Extract success criteria and business constraints
   - Note future requirements that affect implementation decisions
   
   **From DRD (if available):**
   - Review component hierarchy and design system requirements
   - Understand user experience patterns and interaction flows
   - Note visual complexity and responsive design requirements
   - Identify design circuit breakers and fallback options
   
   **From TRD (if available):**
   - Review system architecture and technical constraints
   - Understand data models, API design, and integration requirements
   - Note performance, security, and scalability constraints  
   - Identify technical circuit breakers and simplification strategies

3. **Assess Current State:** Review existing codebase against integrated requirements
   - **Design Assessment (enhanced by DRD):**
     - Identify existing component libraries and design patterns
     - Note current design system implementation and gaps
     - Document existing user experience patterns and conventions
   - **Technical Assessment (enhanced by TRD):**
     - Identify existing architecture patterns and technology stack
     - Note current database schema, API structures, and integrations
     - Document existing testing, deployment, and monitoring setup
   - **Gap Analysis:**
     - Identify what needs to be created vs. modified
     - Note where existing patterns align with DRD/TRD specifications
     - Document areas where circuit breakers might be needed

4. **Phase 1: Generate Requirements-Driven Parent Tasks:** Based on integrated requirements analysis
   - Create high-level tasks that align with DRD component boundaries (when available)
   - Ensure tasks follow TRD technical architecture (when available)  
   - Maintain PRD functional requirements as the driving business value
   - Use your judgment on task count (~5 tasks), but follow DRD/TRD structure when available
   - Present these tasks with their DRD/TRD justification
   - **Fallback Strategy:** When DRD/TRD unavailable, generate PRD-based tasks with noted assumptions
   - Inform the user: "I have generated high-level tasks based on [PRD + DRD + TRD / PRD only]. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."

5. **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".

6. **Phase 2: Generate TDD-First Implementation Sub-Tasks:** Break down each parent task with DRD/TRD guidance and mandatory testing
   - **üß™ TDD Sub-tasks:** All sub-tasks must follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle with tests written first
   - **Design-Driven Sub-tasks:** Follow DRD component specifications with component tests and Playwright validation
   - **Technical-Driven Sub-tasks:** Follow TRD data models, API design with unit tests, integration tests, and API tests
   - **Integration Sub-tasks:** Connect DRD frontend with TRD backend using contract tests and E2E validation
   - **üé≠ Playwright Sub-tasks:** UI testing with screenshots for all user-facing work (mandatory for web apps)
   - **üîç Validation Sub-tasks:** Include validation agent requirements at task completion points
   - **Circuit Breaker Sub-tasks:** Include fallback approaches from DRD/TRD when complexity is high
   - **Backward Compatibility:** Generate reasonable sub-tasks when DRD/TRD unavailable

7. **Identify Requirements-Driven Relevant Files:** List files based on integrated requirements with mandatory testing
   - **From DRD:** Component files, style files, asset files based on design hierarchy + component test files
   - **From TRD:** Data model files, API files, configuration files based on technical architecture + API test files + integration test files
   - **From PRD:** Business logic files, integration files based on functional requirements + unit test files
   - **üß™ TDD Test Files:** Corresponding test files for ALL implementation files (mandatory)
   - **üé≠ Playwright Files:** E2E test files and screenshot validation for web UI (mandatory)
   - **üîç Validation Files:** Validation and retrospective documentation files
   - **Fallback:** Standard file patterns when DRD/TRD unavailable

8. **Generate Enhanced Final Output:** Combine all elements with requirements traceability
   - Show how tasks trace back to PRD, DRD, and TRD requirements
   - Include circuit breaker options and simplification strategies
   - Document assumptions made when requirements are missing

9. **Save Enhanced Task List:** Save to `/tasks/` directory with enhanced metadata
   - Filename: `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` (maintains compatibility)
   - Include references to all source documents (PRD, DRD, TRD)
   - Add creation timestamp and requirements traceability

## Output Format (Enhanced Structure)
The generated task list _must_ follow this enhanced structure with requirements traceability:

```markdown

```

## Interaction Model
The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience
Assume the primary reader of the task list is a **junior developer** who will implement the feature with awareness of the existing codebase context.

## Output
- **Format:** Enhanced Markdown (`.md`) with requirements traceability
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` (maintains compatibility)
- **Content:** Includes references to all source documents (PRD, DRD, TRD)

## Key Improvements Over Original

1. **Requirements-Driven Tasks**: Tasks now follow DRD component hierarchy and TRD technical architecture instead of guessed patterns
2. **Explicit Requirements Traceability**: Each task references specific PRD/DRD/TRD sections that drive the implementation  
3. **Circuit Breakers at All Levels**: Design fallbacks (DRD), technical fallbacks (TRD), and scope fallbacks (PRD)
4. **One-Way Door Prevention**: DRD and TRD analysis ensures future requirements don't get blocked by implementation decisions
5. **Concrete Implementation Guidance**: Sub-tasks reference specific DRD components and TRD patterns instead of generic approaches
6. **Reduced On-the-Fly Decision Making**: Developers follow predetermined design and technical patterns rather than making up solutions
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to PRD-only approach when DRD/TRD unavailable, with clear assumption markers
8. **Enhanced Risk Management**: Clear identification of assumptions and areas where rework might be needed

## Integration Notes
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Works with Claude Code's existing git workflow while adding requirements traceability
- **Improved File Organization**: Leverages Claude Code's file editing capabilities with DRD/TRD-driven file structure
- **Advanced Task Tracking**: Uses TodoWrite tool for internal task tracking with requirements context
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows conventional commit standards with requirements references in commit messages
